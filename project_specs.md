# Optimized Project Specification for JLPT Master: A Japanese Learning WebApp

## Executive Summary
This optimized specification refines the original blueprint for "JLPT Master," a webapp focused on Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT) preparation across N5 to N1 levels. By adopting specification-first AI development, it transforms the high-level overview into a verifiable, phased artifact tailored for autonomous AI agents like Grok 4 Fast. The spec emphasizes precision to mitigate common AI pitfalls such as hallucinations or misinterpretations, drawing from best practices in spec-driven workflows. It incorporates granular task breakdowns, measurable acceptance criteria, ethical considerations, and traceability to ensure reliable implementation. The app targets self-learners worldwide, providing interactive tools like flashcards and quizzes while sourcing content ethically from public APIs and datasets. Estimated MVP timeline: 3-5 weeks with AI assistance, assuming iterative refinement.

## Problem Definition and Business Alignment
The core problem is the lack of accessible, structured JLPT study tools, leading to fragmented learning experiences. The app solves this by aggregating free resources into an interactive platform, aligning with user needs for progressive skill-building in vocabulary, kanji, grammar, reading, and listening. Business goals include high user retention (target: 70% weekly return rate) and educational impact (e.g., 80% quiz pass rate after sessions), measured via analytics. Out-of-scope: Premium features like live tutoring or proprietary content creation. This alignment uses outcome-driven frameworks, focusing on verifiable success like "users achieve 85% mastery in N5 vocabulary after 10 sessions."

## User Stories with Acceptance Criteria
User stories are refined for precision, each with testable criteria to guide AI implementation:

- **Beginner Learner (N5)**: As a beginner, I want basic vocabulary flashcards so I can learn hiragana and simple words.
  - Acceptance: Flashcards display romaji, hiragana, English; flip animation works; 95% load time under 1s; tested on 50 sample items from API.
- **Intermediate User (N3)**: As an intermediate user, I want grammar explanations with examples to understand structures.
  - Acceptance: Explanations include rules, 3+ sentences; quiz integration scores accurately; edge case: Handles ambiguous particles like "wa" vs. "ga."
- **Advanced Learner (N1)**: As an advanced user, I want simulated listening tests with audio.
  - Acceptance: Audio plays without lag (<500ms); questions match transcripts; score breakdown shows weak areas; compliance: Audio from public domain only.
- **Registered User**: As a user, I want progress tracking and recommendations.
  - Acceptance: Dashboard shows mastery % (e.g., 75% for kanji); recommends based on <60% scores; data stored securely with GDPR consent.
- **Any User**: As a user, I want term search with external links.
  - Acceptance: Search returns results in <300ms; links to dictionaries like Jisho.org; handles no-results with suggestions.

These stories use Job Stories format for outcome focus, ensuring AI agents can generate code without assumptions.

## Functional Requirements with Input/Output Specs
Requirements are specified with explicit input formats, outputs, and error handling to prevent garbage-in-garbage-out issues:

1. **Authentication**:
   - Inputs: Email (regex: ^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$), password (min 8 chars, 1 uppercase, 1 number).
   - Outputs: JWT token; profile JSON {userId: string, level: "N5", progress: number}.
   - Error Handling: Invalid email returns "Invalid format"; max 3 failed logins locks for 5min.
   
2. **Content Modules**:
   - Vocabulary: Inputs: Level (N1-N5), query string; Outputs: Array [{word: string, romaji: string, meaning: string, examples: array}]; Fallback: If API fails, use cached data.
   - Kanji: Inputs: Kanji char; Outputs: JSON {readings: {onyomi: array, kunyomi: array}, strokes: array of paths}; Edge: Unicode validation.
   - Grammar/Reading/Listening: Similar schemas, with audio URLs validated for playback.

3. **Interactive Tools**:
   - Flashcards: Spaced repetition (intervals: 1/3/7 days based on score >80%); Outputs: Card JSON with confidence score.
   - Quizzes: Timed (e.g., 30s/question); Metrics: Accuracy >90% for pass; Explanations for wrongs.

4. **Progress and Gamification**:
   - Inputs: Session data; Outputs: Dashboard JSON {streaks: number, badges: array}; Notifications: Browser push if streak >3.

Use Zod/Pydantic schemas for structured outputs to enforce formats.

## Non-Functional Requirements and Metrics
- **Performance**: <2s load; Handle 500 users concurrently; Metrics: 95th percentile response <1.5s (Lighthouse-tested).
- **Security**: HTTPS; Encrypt progress data; OWASP compliance; Ethical: Bias-free content (e.g., diverse examples); Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA (alt text, keyboard nav).
- **Scalability**: Auto-scale on Vercel; Data privacy: Anonymize analytics, opt-in for sharing.
- **UI/UX**: Responsive (mobile-first); Dark mode toggle; User satisfaction target: NPS >8 via feedback forms.

Ethical guardrails: Filter sensitive content; Fairness metric: Demographic parity >95% in examples.

## Technical Architecture and Data Sourcing
- **Stack**: Next.js (frontend), Node/Express (backend), MongoDB (db), Tailwind (styling), JWT (auth).
- **Resources** (ethical sourcing):
  - Vocabulary: https://jlpt-vocab-api.vercel.app/ (JSON fetch).
  - Kanji: https://github.com/AnchorI/jlpt-kanji-dictionary (seed db).
  - Grammar: Parse PDFs from https://japanasubi-en.com/lp/jlptgrammarlist-5/.
  - Practice: Official samples https://www.jlpt.jp/e/samples/forlearners.html.
- Integration: REST APIs; Schemas for data (e.g., Vocab: {level: string, items: array}).

## Phased Development Roadmap
Follow spec-driven phases with AI-optimized checkpoints:

1. **Specify (Week 1)**: Refine this spec using AI prompts (e.g., "Generate detailed blueprint from user stories").
2. **Plan (Week 1)**: Generate tech plan variations; Select based on constraints.
3. **Tasks (Week 2)**: Break into 20+ subtasks (e.g., "Implement vocab API endpoint: Inputs query, Outputs JSON, Test: 100% coverage").
4. **Implement (Weeks 3-4)**: Code tasks in parallel; Review against criteria.
5. **Refine**: Version changes; Quarterly content updates.

## Testing Strategies and Traceability
Use layered testing: Unit (Jest), E2E (Cypress), AI-specific (bias checks). Diverse datasets: Standard JLPT samples, edges (e.g., rare kanji), adversarial (malformed inputs).

### Traceability Matrix

| Requirement ID | Description | Test Case | Acceptance Metric | Status |
|----------------|-------------|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| REQ-1 | Authentication | TC-1: Valid login | Token issued <1s | Pending |
| REQ-2 | Vocabulary Module | TC-2: API fetch | 100% items match source; <300ms | Pending |
| REQ-3 | Progress Tracking | TC-3: Update mastery | Accuracy >99%; GDPR compliant | Pending |

### Contrast Table for Precision

| Vague Spec | Precise Spec | Benefit for AI |
|------------|--------------|----------------|
| "Add flashcards" | "Implement SRS flashcards with intervals 1/3/7 days, JSON output {cardId: string, reviewDate: date}, test on 50 items" | Reduces assumptions, enables auto-testing. |
| "Track progress" | "Dashboard JSON {mastery: number (0-100), weakAreas: array}, update on quiz score >80%, edge: No data shows 0%" | Objective verification, fewer errors. |

## Continuous Refinement and Deployment
Use versioning (e.g., Spec v1.0) for changes; ACME reviews (Assumptions, Constraints, Metrics, Examples) at milestones. Deploy on Vercel; Monitor with Sentry; Open-source on GitHub for contributions. This spec is a living blueprint, optimized for Grok 4 Fast to execute with minimal intervention.
